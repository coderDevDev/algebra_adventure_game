‚úÖ **Clear**: Simple shapes work well at small game sizes  
‚úÖ **Inclusive**: Everyone looks equally cute (no age discrimination)  
‚úÖ **Professional yet playful**: Perfect balance for learning

### **Chibi Proportions Reference:**
```
STANDARD HUMAN:        CHIBI CHARACTER:
    ‚óè                      ‚óè‚óè‚óè
    |                      ‚óè‚óè‚óè  ‚Üê BIG HEAD (1 unit)
   /|\                     /|\
    |                       ‚Ä¢   ‚Üê Small body (1-1.5 units)
   / \                     / \  ‚Üê Stubby legs

Head:Body Ratio:       Head:Body Ratio:
   1:7                    1:1 to 1:1.5
```

### **Chibi Features Checklist:**

- [ ] Small body with stubby limbs

## **13. üéØ FINAL NOTES**

### **Critical Requirements:**

**For ALL Character Sprites (Player + NPCs):**
- ‚úÖ **CHIBI STYLE MANDATORY** - Large head, small body, kawaii proportions
- ‚úÖ **16-frame sprite sheet** (not single images!)
- ‚úÖ **4 directions** with walking animations
- ‚úÖ **Bouncy, cute movement** across frames
- ‚úÖ **Consistent chibi style** with player character
- ‚úÖ **Top-down perspective** maintained throughout
- ‚úÖ **Big expressive eyes** on all characters

**Quality Standards:**
- **Chibi consistency is KEY**: All characters use same proportions (head:body 1:1 to 1:1.5)
- **Cultural authenticity matters**: Filipino features and clothing, but in chibi style
- **Educational context**: Cute characters make math less intimidating
- **Age-appropriate**: Perfect for 10-16 year old students (and appealing to all ages!)
- **Colorful and kawaii**: Bright, cheerful, soft pastel colors with vibrant accents
- **Animated and bouncy**: NPCs should waddle/bounce cutely like the player

### **Chibi Generation Tips:**

**When using Google Gemini or AI generators:**

1. **Always specify "CHIBI" or "KAWAII" style** explicitly
2. **Reference anime/manga chibi proportions**: 
   - "Like Pok√©mon character style"
   - "Similar to Animal Crossing characters"
   - "Kawaii chibi proportions with big head"
3. **Start with chibi base design first**:
   ```
   "Create a cute chibi Filipino student with large head and small body"
   ```
4. **Then request angles**:
   ```
   "Show this chibi character from front, back, left, right views"
   ```
5. **Finally add animations**:
   ```
   "Create walking frames showing bouncy chibi movement"
   ```
6. **Combine into sprite sheet layout**

### **Example Chibi Prompt Structure:**
```
